# delete-jenkins-view

Jenkins views can be deleted from the web itself but one at a time. This will be very difficult if the number of views to be removed is higher.

This Python script can be used to delete multiple views from Jenkins in one single step.

Here URL need to be replaced with the Jenkins url, USER with the Jenkins username and PASS with the Jenkins password.

Please note that we can excude certain views from deletion process. Those names need to be updated instead of VIEW1, VIEW2 etc.
